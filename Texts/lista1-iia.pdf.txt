1.7 To what extent are the following computer systems instances of artificial intelligence:

e Supermarket bar code scanners.

e Web search engines.

e Voice-activated telephone menus.

e Internet routing algorithms that respond dynamically to the state of the network.

1.8 Many of the computational models of cognitive activities that have been proposed in-
volve quite complex mathematical operations, such as convolving an image with a Gaussian
or finding a minimum of the entropy function. Most humans (and certainly all animals) never
learn this kind of mathematics at all, almost no one learns it before college, and almost no
one can compute the convolution of a function with a Gaussian in their head. What sense
does it make to say that the “vision system” is doing this kind of mathematics, whereas the
actual person has no idea how to do it?

1.9 Why would evolution tend to result in systems that act rationally? What goals are such
systems designed to achieve?

1.10 Is Ala science, or is it engineering? Or neither or both? Explain.

1.11 “Surely computers cannot be intelligent—they can do only what their programmers
tell them.” Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?

1.12 ‘Surely animals cannot be intelligent—they can do only what their genes tell them.”
Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?

1.13 “Surely animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent—they can do only what
their constituent atoms are told to do by the laws of physics.” Is the latter statement true, and
does it imply the former?
